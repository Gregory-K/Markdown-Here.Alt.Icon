# Markdown

...is really just ordinary text, *plain and simple*. How is it good for you?

- You just **type naturally**, and the result looks good.
- You **don't have to worry** about clicking formatting buttons.
    - Or fiddling with indentation. (Two spaces is all you need.)

To see what else you can do with Markdown (including **tables**, **images**,
**numbered lists**, and more!) Try it out by typing in this box!

## Code syntax highlighting

There are **multiple syntax highlighting themes** to choose from. Here's one of them:

```javascript
// All the code you will ever need
var hw = "Hello World!"
alert(hw);
```

## Math formulae

My math is so rusty that I barely remember the _quadratic equation_:
${-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \over 2a}$

## Lists

* Bulleted lists
  * with nested bullets
    * are fun!
  * and super easy
* More more more!

1. Numbered lists too!
1. You don't even need to use
1. the right numbers

# Header 1
