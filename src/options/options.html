                <strong>CAUTION:</strong>
                <p>
                  This altered extension was only intended for the author's personal use, and it doesn't offer anything more than a different main icon design. It was plain experimentation now being offered "as is" for anyone to try. It is neither digitally signed nor distributed via the official Thunderbird channels.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You should not use unsigned Add-ons outside the official <a href="https://addons.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/">Thunderbird Add-ons Repository</a>, unless you trust the author/developer or you're able to inspect the source code. It is a serious security risk. The author of the present extension disclaims any responsibility for any damage caused to your Thunderbird installation.

                        Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
                        non-exclusive license:

                        (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
                            Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
                            modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
                            Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
                            as part of a Larger Work; and

                        (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
                            for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
                            Contributions or its Contributor Version.

                        2.2. Effective Date

                        The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
                        become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
                        distributes such Contribution.

                        2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

                        The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
                        this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
                        distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
                        Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
                        Contributor:

                        (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
                            or

                        (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
                            modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
                            Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
                            Version); or

                        (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
                            its Contributions.

                        This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
                        or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
                        the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

                        2.4. Subsequent Licenses

                        No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
                        distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
                        License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
                        permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

                        2.5. Representation

                        Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
                        Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
                        to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

                        2.6. Fair Use

                        This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
                        applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
                        equivalents.

                        2.7. Conditions

                        Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
                        in Section 2.1.

                        3. Responsibilities
                        -------------------

                        3.1. Distribution of Source Form

                        All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
                        Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
                        the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
                        Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
                        License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
                        attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
                        Form.

                        3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

                        If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

                        (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
                            Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
                            the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
                            Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
                            than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

                        (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
                            License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
                            license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
                            the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

                        3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

                        You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
                        provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
                        the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
                        Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
                        Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
                        License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
                        under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
                        the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
                        Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
                        License(s).

                        3.4. Notices

                        You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
                        (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
                        or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
                        the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
                        the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

                        3.5. Application of Additional Terms

                        You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
                        indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
                        Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
                        behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
                        such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
                        You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
                        liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
                        indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
                        disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
                        jurisdiction.

                        4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
                        ---------------------------------------------------

                        If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
                        License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
                        statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
                        the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
                        describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
                        be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
                        Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
                        or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
                        recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

                        5. Termination
                        --------------

                        5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
                        if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
                        compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
                        Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
                        Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
                        ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
                        non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
                        come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
                        Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
                        notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
                        first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
                        from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
                        Your receipt of the notice.

                        5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
                        infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
                        counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
                        directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
                        You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
                        2.1 of this License shall terminate.

                        5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
                        end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
                        have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
                        prior to termination shall survive termination.

                        8. Litigation
                        -------------

                        Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
                        courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
                        place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
                        jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
                        Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
                        cross-claims or counter-claims.

                        9. Miscellaneous
                        ----------------

                        This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
                        matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
                        unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
                        necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
                        that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
                        shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

                        10. Versions of the License
                        ---------------------------

                        10.1. New Versions

                        Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
                        10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
                        publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
                        distinguishing version number.

                        10.2. Effect of New Versions

                        You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
                        of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
                        or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
                        steward.

                        10.3. Modified Versions

                        If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
                        create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
                        modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
                        any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
                        such modified license differs from this License).
